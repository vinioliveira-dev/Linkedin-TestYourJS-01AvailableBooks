## Task requirements (video transcription):
<p>Unlike classical programming languages like Java or C++, JavaScript uses objects within a prototypal inheritance model. In ES 2015 or ES6, the class keyword was introduced. But the class keyword is solely syntactical sugar, it does not change JavaScript's prototypal inheritance model. But we can use class declarations as a replacement for functions.</p>
<p>In this challenge you'll be developing an inventory application for a bookstore. You need to create a book class, which provides information about different books in the store. Each book will have a title, author, ISBN, and keep track of the number of available copies.</p>
<p>You'll need a way to get each book's availability. If there aren't any copies of the book left, the function should return out of stock. If there are less than 10 copies, the function should return low stock. Otherwise the function should return in stock.</p>
<p>You'll also need a function for selling a book. This will take the number of copies sold and subtract it from the total number of copies. If no argument is passed, we can default the number of copies to sell to one.</p>
<p>Lastly, you'll want a restock function, which takes in a number of copies to restock and adds it to the total number of copies. If no argument is passed, we can default the restock number to five. You should use JavaScript's class keyword as well as a getter function for the availability method.</p>
<p>Pause the video here, develop your solution. And when you're ready, come back, and I'll walk you through my solution.</p>
